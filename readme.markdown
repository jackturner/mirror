Eventually this document should explain the process for a setting up this mirror thing. Both the configuration of the Android device used (which obviously could be replaced with any number of thingsâ€¦ I just happen to have a spare Nexus 7 tablet) and the assembly of the mirror.

There will also be links and notes that relate to development as I work on this thing.


Links and notes relevant to configuration of Android device:
